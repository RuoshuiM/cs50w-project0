Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Project Description: https://docs.cs50.net/web/2018/x/projects/0/project0.html

I'm currently a student at Stuyvesant High School. Seeing that my school's website is bueatiful but yet mobile responsive, I tried to remake it to be a mobile responsive site.

There are only six pages in my version, whereas in the official site, there are probably hundres of pages. I can't do that easily since I'm only using client-side technology. The unavailable pages are not linked. Their corresponding links on the navbar are disabled.

Each of the pages in my site corresponds to a page in the [original site](https://www.stuy.edu).

The only available pages are: index, history of school, peter stuyvesant, mission statement, message from principle, and contact page.
